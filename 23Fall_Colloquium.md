# 231012. What does the Milky Way look like?
>In spite of much work, the overall spiral structure morphology of the Milky Way remains somewhat uncertain. In the last two decades, accurate distance measurements have provided us with an opportunity to solve this issue. Using the precise locations of very young objects, for the first time, we propose that our galaxy has a multiple-arm morphology that consists of two-arm symmetry (the Perseus and Norma Arms) in the inner parts and that extends to the outer parts, where there are several long, irregular arms (the Centaurus, Sagittarius, Carina, Outer, and Local Arms).

Biography: 
Dr. Ye Xu is a radio astronomer. His major areas of research are in the formation of massive stars and Galactic structure, in particular through measuring the trigonometric parallax of masers and using Gaia young stellar objects to reconstruct the spiral arm structure of the Milky Way.
示踪旋臂结构的几类天体：
年轻恒星OB示踪恒星：寿命短，还没移出旋臂已经死掉了

最关键的是距离定准，测出旋臂上天体的距离

研究银河系旋臂结构里程碑：Morgan 1952,1953，用OB star, 1-2 kpc
后来Oort1958用HI gas一下子拓展到3-4 kpc，还有Kerr 1962也用HI gas，一下子把Morgan的工作比下去了。

用疏散星团，在离开旋臂之前也可示踪旋臂
Courtes1972用HII区发现4条旋臂

Georgelin&Georgelin1976  standard model of MW's sprial arms 得出太阳附近没有旋臂  引用700+

本模型和Reid19模型的一个很大区别就是本模型把Sgr arm和Persus arm相交，对MW-like galaxy的统计显示，two-inner arm的星系占80%多，而four arms只有2%，这个新模型把银河系归为了很常见的那类，而不是special

未来：用SKA细化，并且补充南天数据
